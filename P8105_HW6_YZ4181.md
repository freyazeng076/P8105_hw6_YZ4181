## Problem 1

``` r
birthweigh = read_csv("./birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = recode(babysex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female"),
    babysex = factor(babysex),
    frace = recode(frace, 
                   `1` = "White",
                   `2` = "Black",
                   `3` = "Asian",
                   `4` = "Peutro",
                   `8` = "Other"),
    frace = factor(frace),
    mrace = recode(mrace,
                   `1` = "White",
                   `2` = "Black",
                   `3` = "Asian",
                   `4` = "Peutro",
                   `8` = "Other" ),
    mrace = factor(mrace),
    malform = recode(malform, `0` = "Absent", `1` = "Present"),
    malform = factor(malform))
```

-   The original data set includes 4342 observations and 20 variables.
    There is no missing value. The variable of baby sex, father race,
    mother race, and malformations are re-coded based on the information
    and converted into factors. Other variables remain as numeric.

#### Propose regression model

The birth weight of the baby depends on baby’s length at birth, baby’s
sex and mother’s weight at delivery

``` r
propose_model= lm(bwt ~ blength + delwt + babysex, data = birthweigh)

propose_model %>% broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(
    term = replace(term, term == "blength", "baby's length"),
    term = replace(term, term == "delwt", "mother's weight at delivery"),
    term = replace(term, term == "babysexmale", "baby sex (male)")
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term                        |  estimate | p.value |
|:----------------------------|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)                 | -3987.529 |   0.000 |
| baby’s length               |   134.276 |   0.000 |
| mother’s weight at delivery |     2.862 |   0.000 |
| baby sex (male)             |     9.658 |   0.348 |
